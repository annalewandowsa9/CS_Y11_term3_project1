## Pygame examples
- `const` contains standard constants (like window size, colors, gravity etc)
- `object` has an implementation of the moving `Object`, subordinate to standard physics
- `free-fall` is a script using `Object` that will freely fall
- `control` is a script using keyboard input to control our object.

## Task:
in the long run: implement the PONG game

### Subtask 1:
- implement a friction (maybe in a separate `Object`), that will be further used for paddles
- create `pong` script that will spawn two paddles and one ball that will be freely floating
